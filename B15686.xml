            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

And an Inventor being once made, and given vp, shall still stand, and bee a ground to charge any person, during the time of the foure yeares of the said Taxation, vnlesse the partie change, or otherwayes employ his summes: And then hee shall giue vp a new Inventor, which shall bee a new ground of a charge, and the former shall cease.

And if by slouth, or malice, the Clerke shall happen to delay, or shift the Lieges resorting to the sayd Courtes to the effect aforesayd, (Complaint being made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the Lordes of His Maiesties Secret Counsell) the sayd Clerkes shall be punished accordingly, at the discretion of the said Lords. And at any Court day, preceeding any Tearme, it shall be lawfull for any person to compeare, and offer to giue vp his Inventor, which the Clerk and Iudge shall be astricted to receiue.</p>
               <p>FURTHER, For the better observation of the said Statute, It is declared, That whosoever receiveth, retaineth, or conditioneth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any Annuell-rent, and concealeth the same, or any part thereof: or in giving vp of his Inventor of Debtes, and Annuels owing by him vnto his just Creditors, giveth vp more then hee is iustly addebted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, Whosoever first discovereth, and revealeth either the Annuell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, or Annuell which is more then the vp-givers iust debt, shall for his reward haue the halfe of that Tearmes concealed Annuell, and as much as the halfe of that Annuell which shall bee discovered to haue beene vnjustly given vp. And in case it shall happen any person what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, by vertue of his vp-given Inventor, to be charged for payment of his Taxation, and at the time of his charge to declare in presence of a Iudge, by his great Oath solemnedly sworne, that his Debtor is a Banke-rupt, whereby hee is disabled to make payment of his Taxation, and is contented that the Kings Maiestie shall haue the whole Annuell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb facs="tcp:178028:8"/> addebted vnto him by his banke-rupt debter of that Tearme: His said declaration shall be a sufficient Liberation to him of the same. And for eschewing of malicious Dilatours of those who haue omitted or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed their summes, IT IS ordained, That whensoever any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son shall accuse or dilate another of concealing or omitting of Summes the time of making his Inventor, Hee shall condescend vpon some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable cause of his dilation, and shall finde caution [<hi>de judicato solvi</hi>] in case he faile in proving that which he dilateth: And there shall not such actions of dilations bee lawfull against dead persons, their Heires, nor Exequutors: Neither shall it bee lawfull, after yeare and day, after the expiring of the sayd Taxation, to intend any such action. And in case any person purchase wed-sette of Lands, and set the same backe againe in tacke unto him who wed-set the same unto him, The Tacks-man, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessour of the Landes, shall pay for the stent of the Landes, and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the wed-set shall pay for the Annuell-rent of his money which hee hath on the Land, as if the same were imployed for Annuell-rent. AT TOUR, IT shall not bee lawfull, by no manner of way, for any Creditour to get reliefe of his Debtor, of this Taxation which is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vpon Annuell-rents by this Statute, vnder the paines contained in the Actes of Parliament made against Usurers. And concerning Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, IT IS declared, That their Minorities shall no wayes priviledge them: But their Tutors and Curators shall giue vp the Inventors of their Annuell-rents in their names: which if the sayd Tutors and Curators faile to doe, the said Minores shall incurre the like danger as others, and at their perfect age shall haue action of Reliefe against their said Tutors and Curators for that cause. And in case any person depart our of this Kingdome, after the publication of this present Act, the same shall no wayes excuse him from giving vp of an Inventor of his Annuell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes, and payment of the said Taxation, and vnder-lying of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger contained in this present Act. But those who are presently foorth of this Realme, and shall not returne before the Tearme of Martinmesse next, they shall not come vnder the danger of this Act, vntill the Tearme of Whitsonday next: Providing that at that tearme they giue up their Inventor, and pay their Taxation, as if they had been present within this Realme before the foresaid Tearme of Martinmesse next. And for the vp-lifting of the foresayd Taxation, granted vpon Annuell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes, And to the effect his Maiesties generall Collector thereof may know now whom to craue and charge for the same, IT IS Statu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and Ordained, That within every Shyreffdome, Stewardrie.

And where these Offices are not heretable, but changeable, The Clerkes within the said Iurisdictions ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their offices, [<hi>advitam</hi>] shall bee Collectors thereof. And in case the sayd Clerkes haue not already found sufficient Caution for dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of their duties in their Offices, they shall bee holden before they haue any intromission with the same Taxation, to finde sufficient Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
